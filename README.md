## C Domain on HackerRank

The C domain on HackerRank is a dedicated section where programmers solve problems using the C programming language.
It focuses on strengthening your knowledge of low-level programming concepts, such as:
1. Input/Output basics

2. Loops and conditionals

3. Functions and recursion

4. Pointers and memory management

5. Strings and arrays manipulation

6. Structures, unions, and bitwise operations
